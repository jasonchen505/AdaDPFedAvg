This repository contains the codes for our summer study paper: 

> [Correlated Noise Injection for Differentially Private Fedrated Learning]

Our code is based on the codes for [On the Convergence of FedAvg on Non-IID Data ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02189.pdf)



## Usage

1. First generate data by the following code. Here `generate_random_niid` is used to generate the dataset named as ` mnist unbalanced ` in our paper,  where the number of samples among devices follows a power law. `generate_equal` is used to generate the dataset named as ` mnist balanced ` where we force all devices to have the same amount of samples. More non-iid distributed datasets could be found in [FedProx](<https://github.com/litian96/FedProx>).

    ```
   cd fedpy
   python data/mnist/generate_random_niid.py
   python data/mnist/generate_equal.py
   python data/synthetic/generate_synthetic.py
   ```

2. Then start to train. You can run a single algorithm on a specific configuration like

    ```
   python main.py --gpu --dataset $DATASET --clients_per_round $K --num_round $T --num_epoch $E --batch_size $B --lr $LR --device $device --seed $SEED --model $NET --algo $ALGO  --noaverage --noprint
   ```

#### Notes

- There are three choices for `$ALGO`, namely `fedavg4` (containning the Scheme I and II), `fedavg5` (for the original scheme) and `fedavg9` (for the Transformed Scheme II).

- If you don't want to use the Scheme I (where we sample device acccording to $p_k$ and simply average local parameters), please add `--noaverage`.

- If you want to mute the printed information, please use `--noprint`.

3. Once the trainning is started, logs that containning trainning statistics will be automatically created in ` result/$DATASET`. Each run has a unique log file name in this way `year-month-day-time_$ALGO_$NET_wn10_tn100_sd$SEED_lr$LR_ep$E_bs$B_a/w`, for example, 
    ```
   2019-11-24T12-05-13_fedavg4_logistic_wn10_tn100_sd0_lr0.1_ep5_bs64_a
   ```

4. During the trainning, you visualize the process by running either of the following

  ```
   tensorboard --logdir=result/$DATASET
   tensorborad --logdir=result/$DATASET/$LOG
   # For example
   tensorboard --logdir=result/mnist_all_data_0_equal_niid/
   tensorboard --logdir=result/mnist_all_data_0_equal_niid/2019-11-24T12-05-13_fedavg4_logistic_wn10_tn100_sd0_lr0.1_ep5_bs64_a
  ```

5. All the codes we used to draw figures are in `plot/`. You can find some choices of hyperparameters in both our paper and the scripts in `plot/`.
